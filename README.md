## üìã Game Explanation

Triple Triad is a strategic 2-player card game played on a 3x3 board.  
- Each player has a hand of 5 cards.  
- Cards have four sides (top, right, bottom, left) with different power values.  
- Players take turns placing cards on the board, attempting to flip the opponent's cards by placing cards with higher adjacent values.  
- The player with the most cards of their color at the end wins.

This web project lets you play against the computer or another player online, using a selection of classic cards.
